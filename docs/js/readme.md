# Using Javascript to access the 123test API

Adding tests to your website can be done easily using our Javascript SDK. With just a few lines of Javascript and almost no change to your markup you can include tests and reports to existing pages. See the [Full Example](examples/full-example.md) for a template.

We utilize [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) to restrict API requests to whitelisted domains. Additionally, every request must contain a valid API key for identification. Our client side Javascript library handles all requests and makes sure that the correct headers are set.
